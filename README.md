# Getting Started on Cloud Computing

This is the repository of a workshop/lesson "[Getting Started on Cloud Computing](https://pcbouman-eur.github.io/workshop-getting-started-cloud/)".
It uses the Jekyll styles and site setup of [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) but is in no way officially affiliated with them.
This lessons builds on an alpha-version of the lesson on [Introduction to Using the Shell in a High-Performance Computing Context](http://www.hpc-carpentry.org/hpc-shell/).
But rather than a focus on HPC, it focuses on more private cloud computing, i.e. running your code on a typical AWS/Azure/Google Cloud Linux instance.
For that purpose, some things were changed:

* Added an episode with general history on computing an some explanation what the Cloud actually is
* Added an episode that explains how you typically set up a cloud instance, in the example Azure is used but general principles are discussed.
* Less focus on security when connecting to SSH. No RSA-keypairs are used in the workshop itself, this part is shortened and moved to a callout.
* Added three versions of an episode that discusses how to run your own programming code. The three versions are for three languages: Python, R and Java.
* Added a lesson that discusses `tmux`, so users can easily disconnect when their computations are running, and `cron`, in case they want to run something periodically (e.g. scraping)
